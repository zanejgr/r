#Task 1
```{r t1}
grades=data.table(
  "category"=c("clickers","quizzes","labs","assignments","exam 1","exam 2","projects","final exam"),
  "weights(%)"=c(10,5,10,15,10,10,10,30)
)

kable(grades)%>%
  kable_styling("striped","condensed")%>%
  column_spec(1, width="5cm")
ggplot(grades,position="fill")+
  geom_col( aes(x="",y=grades$weights, fill = grades$category))+
  coord_polar("y")
```
#Task 2
```{r t2}
ggplot(ddt,aes(x=WEIGHT,y=LENGTH, color=MILE))+
  geom_point()+facet_grid(ddt$SPECIES~ddt$RIVER)
```
From the left 3 plots, it is shown that the left 3 rivers are either shorter than the TRM or 
measurements were only taken upstream. The plots for LMBass and SMBuffalo were empty for all but the 
TRM, indicating no data.

Line A in the example code orders each unique MILE entry in DDT. 
Line B lists the entries for each frequency as a vector of vectors sorted by the distance downstream

The mean value of CCatfish in the FCM river is 
```{r t2.2}  
  ddt%>%filter(RIVER=="FCM"&&SPECIES=="CCATFISH")%>%summarise(avg=mean(DDT))

```

#Task 3
A, B, D and F are quantitative. C, E and G are qualitative
#Task 4
Simple random sampling involves making sure each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. Usually with a random number generator.

Stratified random sampling classifies the sample into classes called strata, and samples from each strata like above, then combining them into a sample.

Clustered sampling classifies and then analyses each member of the randomly selected classes

Systematic sampling selects every kth item in a population for sampling.

#Task 5
```{r t5}
  
  mtbe[sample(dim(mtbe)[1],5,replace = FALSE),]
  mtbe%>%na.omit%>%filter(Aquifier=="Bedrock")%>%summarise(sd(Depth))
  
```

#Task 6
```{r t6}
  Earthquake[sample(dim(Earthquake)[1],5,replace = FALSE),]
  plot(ts(Earthquake$MAGNITUDE))
  summarise(Earthquake,median(MAGNITUDE))
  
```

#Task 7
The method used was stratified random sampling,
with the population being all the fish in the Tenessee River and its tributaries.
The qualitative variables are River and Species

#Task 8
The book uses a bar chart. The variables measured are robot type and number, with legs only being the most common type in use.
```{r t8}
  (rep(c("legs only","wheels only","both","neither"),c(63,20,8,15)))%>%pareto
```

#Task 9
```{r t9}
  dt<-data.table(product=c("windows","explorer","office"),count=c(6,12,32))
  ggplot(dt,position="fill")+
    geom_col(aes(x="",y=count,fill=product))+
    coord_polar("y")
  pareto(rep(dt$product,dt$count))
  
```

#Task 10
```{r t10}
with(SWDefects,pie3D(c(sum(defect==TRUE),sum(defect==FALSE)),labels=c("true","false")))
```
The software is unlikely to have defects.
#Task 11
