```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
source("C:/Users/Adrienne/Dropbox/R/lab7/mylab7fns.R")
```

## Q2
```{r t2 }
mychisim(n1=10,sigma1 = 10, iter = 1500, mean1 = 20)
```

## Q3

```{r t3}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
