  ****Introduction **

**_1.1   
  _****_Purpose _**

Our product owner has expressed a need to broadcast a message
  to a group of users with a single button press in case of an emergency. We
  believe that the APOCS system represents an ideal solution.

**_1.2   
  _****_Solution Overview _**

The APOCS
  program will allow its users to send a mass-message to a list of contacts,
  with a single button push.  As such,
  the users will not need anything other than a minimal general purpose
  ios/android interface.
